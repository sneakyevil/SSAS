## SSAS
Simple Steam Account Switcher

### Important:
This account switcher works different than any other account switcher, it doesn't store any password it just simply copy & replace VDF file under %steam%\config and edit registry values to restore old account login data.

This also means that you can't log out off from your account you're currently using for switching because the steam will clear the required data that it saved for desired account.

### Usage:
Log to any account with "Remember Password" and inside the program select "Add Account", thats basically all now you can freely switch to that account, but make sure you never (sign out) from the account.
If you need to switch account either select "New Login" inside the program or exit and launch steam again.
